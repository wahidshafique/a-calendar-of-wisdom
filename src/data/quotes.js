      '\n\n\nOne of the worst prejudices known is held\nby the majority of the so-called scholars of our time, who claim that a person\ncan live without faith.\n\n\n\nThroughout the centuries, in every age, people have wanted to know\nor at least have a vague idea about the source, the beginning, and the final purpose\nof their existence. Religion satisfies this requirement, and makes clear those\nconnections which unite all people as brothers, revealing to them that they have\nthe same source of origin, the same task for their lives, and the same general final\ngoal.\n\n— Giuseppi\nMazzini \n\n\n\nThe essential meaning of every religion is to answer the question\n"Why do I live, and what is my attitude to the limitless world which\nsurrounds me?" There is not a single religion, from the most sophisticated\nto the most primitive, which does not have as its basis the definition of this\nattitude of a person to the world.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of all religions lies a single unifying truth. Let\nPersians bear their taovids, Jews wear their caps, Christians bear their cross,\nMuslims bear their sickle moon, but we have to remember that these are all only\nouter signs. The general essence of all religions is love to your neighbor, and\nthat this is requested by Manuf, Zoroaster, Buddha, Moses, Socrates, Jesus,\nSaint Paul, and Mohammed alike.\n\n— Edward\nFlūgel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nlife of a person without faith is the life of an animal.\n\n\n',

      "\n\n\nAmong all sins, there is one which\ncompletely opposes the major blessing of human life, which is your love for your brother: there\nis no worse sin than to destroy this major joy of life, by feeling rage and\nhatred for your brother.\n\n\n\nSeneca, a\nwise man from Rome, said that when you want to escape from your rage, when you\nfeel that it grows, the best thing to do is to stop. Do not do anything: do not\nwalk, do not move, do not speak. If your body or your tongue moves at this\nmoment, then your rage will grow.\n\nRage is very harmful for all people, but it is most\nharmful for the man who experiences it.\n\n\n\nAn evil person damages\nnot only others but himself.\n— After\nSocrates\n\n\n\nYour enemy will pay you back with rage, will make\nyou suffer, but the biggest damage to you will be caused by the rage and hatred\nexisting in your heart. Neither your father, nor your mother, nor all your\nfamily can make you more good than your heart can when it forgives and forgets\nits abuse.\n\n— Dhammapada,\na book of Buddhist Wisdom\n\n\n\n\nYour rage cannot be justified by anything.

If it is not a sacrifice but a discharge of excess, it can only irritate\nthose who receive it. \n\n\n",
